## Recommendation API

- **Personalized Recommendations Endpoint:** 
  We have implemented a new API endpoint (`/api/recommendations`) to fetch personalized product recommendations for users. This endpoint leverages Google Gemini's generative AI capabilities and Langchain to process user data (viewed products and purchase history) and generate relevant recommendations.

### Folder Structure

- `app/api/recommendations/route.ts` - API route handler for recommendations.
- `src/utils/recommendations.ts` - Utility functions for interacting with the Gemini API and processing recommendations.
- (Optional) `src/lib/database.ts` - Database interaction functions if using a database for storing viewed products.

### Implementation Details

- **Langchain Integration:**
  - Langchain is used to construct prompts for the Gemini API. These prompts include:
    - Recent purchase history from the mock order data.
    - Product IDs of products viewed by the user.

- **Gemini API Interaction:**
  - The `recommendations.ts` utility functions handle sending the Langchain-generated prompts to the Gemini API.
  - The API response (product recommendations) is parsed and returned in a structured format.

- **Data Handling:**
  - For this POC, viewed products can be stored in either:
    - Local storage on the client-side (simpler but less persistent).
    - A database (more robust but requires additional setup).

### Error Handling and Rate Limiting

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error handling is implemented to handle potential issues like API failures, invalid responses, or data inconsistencies.
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - If the Gemini API has usage limits, rate limiting mechanisms are in place to prevent exceeding them.

### Future Considerations (Beyond POC)

- **Recommendation Algorithms:**
  - Explore more advanced recommendation algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) for improved accuracy and personalization.
- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Implement real-time updates to recommendations as users browse and interact with products.
