# Backend

Backend: I developed integration services with AWS Cognito to handle user registration, session management, and email-based registration confirmation. Additionally, I created APIs simulating a real-world application by using mocks as a data source, allowing the system to function as a complete management dashboard. The APIs are fully functional, providing essential operations such as viewing users, products, and orders.
