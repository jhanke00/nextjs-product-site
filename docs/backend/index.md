# Backend

For this challenge, a server was developed using the NestJS backend framework. I know that the challenge was initially proposed in NextJS, but I'm not very familiar with it (I don't mind learning in the future), so in order to avoid using any AI solution, I chose to use a framework from my day-to-day work. More details and instructions on how to run the project, upload Docker and which issues were resolved with this solution are in the server's README.

PS: I really would have liked to have resolved more issues, but it was a busy week, I preferred to deliver a few well-done things than the opposite.
