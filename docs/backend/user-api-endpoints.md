# User API Endpoints

This document describes the User API endpoints for large datasets.

## Endpoints

1. Get User Information

   - URL: `/api/users/[userId]`
   - Method: GET
   - Response: User object

2. Get User Orders

   - URL: `/api/users/[userId]/orders`
   - Method: GET
   - Query Parameters:
     - page (optional): Page number for pagination
     - limit (optional): Number of items per page
   - Response: Paginated list of orders

3. Get User Total Spent
   - URL: `/api/users/[userId]/total-spent`
   - Method: GET
   - Response: Total amount spent by the user

## Large Dataset Considerations

- Pagination is implemented for the orders endpoint to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
- Caching is used to improve response times for frequently accessed data.
- Database queries are optimized for large datasets using indexing and pre-aggregation.
