### All Users Page

This page shows all the available users from the small dataset. Unlike the first module, data is not coming through an API. I have created utility functions to retrieve the data from the datasets.

### Order Details Page

This page shows all the available data for the user. This is a dynamically generated route from Next JS.

All the orders and its items are displayed along with the total spent for that order. Also, calculated the total amount spent by the user.
