# Utils Folder

Documentation on the utility functions and classes within the `utils` folder.

## Overview

The `utils` folder contains utility functions and classes that provide reusable logic and operations throughout the application. These utilities help in maintaining clean and organized code by abstracting common tasks and operations.

## Folder Structure

- `orders/`

  - `OrderUtils.ts`:
    - **Description**: Provides utility functions related to orders, including fetching user orders, calculating totals, and other order-specific operations.
    - **Functions/Methods**:
      - `fetchUserOrders(userId: string)`: Retrieves a list of orders for a specified user.
      - `calculateTotalSpent(userId: string)`: Calculates the total amount spent by a user based on their orders.

- `users/`
  - `UserUtils.ts`:
    - **Description**: Contains utility functions related to user operations, such as fetching user details and performing user-specific logic.
    - **Functions/Methods**:
      - `fetchUserById(userId: string)`: Retrieves user details based on their ID.

## Utilities

### `OrderUtils.ts`

- **Purpose**: To handle order-related logic and operations.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `fetchUserOrders(userId: string)`:
    - **Description**: Fetches all orders associated with a given user ID.
    - **Returns**: An array of order objects.
  - `calculateTotalSpent(userId: string)`:
    - **Description**: Computes the total amount spent by the user based on their orders.
    - **Returns**: A number representing the total amount spent.

### `UserUtils.ts`

- **Purpose**: To manage user-related logic and operations.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `fetchUserById(userId: string)`:
    - **Description**: Fetches detailed information about a user using their ID.
    - **Returns**: A user object containing details such as first name, last name, email, and phone number.

## Usage

- **Importing Utilities**:

  - Utilities can be imported into components or other files where their functionality is needed. For example:

    ```typescript
    import { OrderUtils } from '@/src/utils/orders/OrderUtils';
    import { UserUtils } from '@/src/utils/users/UserUtils';
    ```

- **Function Calls**:

  - Call the utility functions directly where needed in your code. For example:

    ```typescript
    const orderUtils = new OrderUtils();
    const orders = orderUtils.fetchUserOrders(userId);
    const totalSpent = orderUtils.calculateTotalSpent(userId);

    const userUtils = new UserUtils();
    const user = userUtils.fetchUserById(userId);
    ```

## Considerations

- **Error Handling**:

  - Ensure that appropriate error handling is implemented when using utility functions, especially when dealing with external data sources or API calls.

- **Testing**:
  - Utility functions should be tested thoroughly to ensure they handle various scenarios and edge cases.
